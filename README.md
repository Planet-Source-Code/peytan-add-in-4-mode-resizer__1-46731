## Add\-In: 4 mode Resizer


</div>

### Description

This is an (in my opinion) great add-in for adding resizing capabilities to your projects. It is based on the class ControlResizer from Edward Catchpole (you can find it on http://www.planetsourcecode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=46203&lngWId=1). I have changed it a little but so you can set a minimum width/height for your form and when you are setting properties for an MDI Child, it first sets the height and width to the ones you used in design-time. Also I have changed the way of proportionally resizing things, because it just didn't work for me. Now it does. I hope you take time to look at this code, leave comments and benefit from it (this is the best thing I have seen that is 100% free so far). Updates are coming up.
 
### More Info
 
All you have to do is click.

Ok, for rblanch, here is how to use the code:

Your open the project and compile it

Then you have to restart your VB6 instance or goto Add-Ins|Add-In Manager... and double click Resizer Add-In

Now you will have a menu-item called Resizer Add-In in the menu Add-Ins

Click that item and the window will appear, listing all your forms,his containers, and the controls of that container.

For every form you want to resize, click 'Add Necessary Code',for every control click what has to be resized.

Don't bother click 'Not', just click what has to be resized, the Not will automatically be filled in

I have noticed the height of listboxes doesn't resize well.
